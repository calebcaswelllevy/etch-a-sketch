##this project is an iteractive drawing board which allows the user to choose the number of pixels, and the color. It was created as a learning project to get more comfortable using grid layouts, and creating dynamic content using javascript.

##I used bootstrap for general styling.

##i used CSS grid to create the basic grid

##I used javascript queries to color the grid based on mouse movement
